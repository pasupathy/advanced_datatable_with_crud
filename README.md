# advanced_datatable_with_crud

This is a sample Create,Read,Update and Delete records in Flutter.
For Read / Listing , it uses <b>advanced_datatable</b> package which by default, comes with pagination, page size,sorting, general search using one text input
I have added extra features by adding a dropdown of all the fields and a text input, with them you can search by fields
At the end of a row , I have added action column edit and delete
Edit will navigate to new page with selected row values populating the form, complete with validation
Delete uses flutter show dialog and alert dialog to prompt cancel or confirm deletion
